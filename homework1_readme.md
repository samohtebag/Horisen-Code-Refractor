# Horiseon Code Refractor Assignment

## Introduction

Originally, when the Horiseon website was created, it didn't met the modern standards of acessibilities, according to the Americans with Disabilities Act. This law
requires businesses to make accomodations for those with disabilities. In this exercise, we refractored the appliication code to meet the requirements of of the ADA
without changing any part of the appearance of the website.

The HTML was redone to include semantic HTML elements, making sure we're following the correct structure of positions and styles. 

First, I changed the title of the site to be in line with the actual company name, including a semi-full description of what the site is and its purpose. Next,
I replaced all of the div tags with semantic HTML elements throughout the structure of the code document to allow for a friendlier read view, and fixed some of the elements of the existing HTML as they were not functioning correctly.
